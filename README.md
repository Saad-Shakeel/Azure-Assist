# Azure Assist Chatbot

## Overview
Azure Assist Chatbot is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to handle queries specifically related to Microsoft Azure. Built using Python and the Streamlit platform, the chatbot leverages the **Gemini-1.5-Flash** model to deliver accurate and context-aware responses. 

The chatbot uses a **system prompt** to enforce a strict operational scope, ensuring it only responds to questions related to Microsoft Azure. If a user's query is unrelated to Azure, the chatbot politely declines to answer, maintaining focus on its domain of expertise. 

To safeguard against prompt injection attacks (malicious attempts to alter the chatbotâ€™s behavior through user inputs), we integrate **Lakera Guard**, a robust security framework for language models.

## Key Features

1. **Gemini-1.5-Flash Model**:
   - The chatbot is powered by the Gemini-1.5-Flash model, offering state-of-the-art language understanding and generation.
   - Obtain the LLM API from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and store it in the `API_KEYS.py` file under the variable name `Gemeni_API`.

2. **Prompt Injection Protection**:
   - To safeguard against prompt injection attacks that could alter the chatbot's behavior, the project integrates **Lakera Guard**.
   - Acquire the Lakera Guard API key from [Lakera Guard's website](https://platform.lakera.ai/account/api-keys) and store it in the `API_KEYS.py` file under the variable name `LAKERA_GUARD_API_KEY`.

3. **Streamlit Application**:
   - Built on Streamlit, enabling an intuitive and interactive user interface for the chatbot.
